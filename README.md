# Guide-towards-CI-CD-pipeline
### Introduction ### 
 * __CI/CD pipelines__ are tools used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications.
 * Goal of CI/CD pipelines is to ensure faster and more reliable software delivery by automating various stages of the development lifecycle.
 * __CI (Continuous Integration)__
     * A process where team member integrate their work continuously shared repository
     * With CI, each code change triggers an automated build process that compiles the 
       code, runs tests, and checks for any integration issues.
     * primary goal of CI is to detect and resolve issues early in the development cycle, 
       ensuring that the codebase remains stable and functional.
     * Best achieved using GIT.
 * __CD (Continuous Deployment)__
     * After CI process,deploying applications on production like environment and running 
      automation test to ensure the build is ready for release
     * It ensure build is always in deployment state
 * The CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps that code changes go through, starting from 
    source code management (e.g., Git repository) to the final deployment.
 * The pipeline typically involves steps such as building the code, running unit tests, 
   integration tests, packaging the application, deploying it to different environments 
   (development, staging, production), and running additional tests in each stage.
###  key components and technologies typically involved in a CI/CD pipeline ###
1)__Version Control System (VCS):__ A VCS such as Git is used to track changes to the source code, enabling collaboration and maintaining a history of code modifications.

2)__Build Automation Tools:__ Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD enable the automation of the build process. They pull the code from the VCS, compile it, and generate executable artifacts.

3)__Testing Frameworks:__ Unit testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit for Java, pytest for Python) are utilized to create and execute automated tests to ensure the code behaves as expected. Additional testing types, such as integration tests or end-to-end tests, may also be included.

4)__Artifact Repository:__ A repository like JFrog Artifactory or Nexus is used to store and manage built artifacts, including binaries, libraries, or container images.

5)__Configuration Management:__ Tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef help automate the configuration of deployment environments and ensure consistency across different environments.

6)__Containerization:__ Container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes are often employed to package applications and their dependencies, providing consistent and isolated execution environments.

7)__Orchestration Tools:__ Platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm enable the management and scaling of containers, ensuring efficient deployment and high availability of applications.

8)__Continuous Deployment/Release:__ Tools like Spinnaker or Harness enable the automated deployment of applications to various environments, such as development, staging, and production.

9)__Monitoring and Logging:__ Services like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) are commonly used to monitor application performance, collect logs, and gain insights into the deployed systems.
